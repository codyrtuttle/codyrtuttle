# Hey there!

I'm Cody Tuttle. I'm a researcher and data scientist. I spend my days as a research scientist at Minnesota Management and Budget, where I specialize in impact evaluation, human services, and social policy. I love data science and visualization with R and you can find some of my code here on my GitHub page. I also keep a blog where I write about explore data and policy topics I care about, mostly in R, which you can find at [codyrtuttle.netify.app](https://codyrtuttle.netlify.app/).
